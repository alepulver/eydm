# Installation

In Ubuntu, R can be installed with `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev`. In case a newer version is needed, check [here](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README).

Then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is a good IDE for all platforms. The latest beta version is required to use `rmarkdown` and `shiny` from the menu.

Note that to create PDFs from *RStudio* in Ubuntu you also need `texlive-latex-extras` and `texlive-fonts-recommended`.

# Packages

There is no standard dependency manager that comes with R, but there are many solutions:

- Manually install from CRAN: `install.packages(NAME)`
- Manually install from github: `devtools::install_github("USER/REPO")` (requires *devtools*)
- Automatically with [rbundler](https://github.com/opower/rbundler)
- Automatically with [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)

Note that automatic dependency managers also track package versions for ensuring reproducibility and compatibility. The downside is that they store source and binaries under the project's directory.

# Content creation

With [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), it's possible to create HTML documents, slides for presentations and PDFs for reports directly from R. An advantage is to work with the real data, without need to export plots and import them in LaTeX or other programs (as well as keeping them up to date).

Another interesting option is to create interactive reports in the form of web pages or slides, also generated from R code without any HTML or Javascript. See [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/).

# Tips

- Use factors for qualitative (ordered or unordered) variables.
- Don't use base graphics, go for [lattice](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/graphics/lattice.cfm) or [ggplot2](http://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-cheatsheet-for-visualizing-distributions/).
- There are better alternatives for `summary` in [additional packages](http://www.statmethods.net/stats/descriptives.html).
- Learn R's formula syntax as soon as possible: it's used for models, plots, etc.
- Use `plyr` to summarize, split, process and combine data
- Use `reshape2` to convert factor variables to columns or vice versa
- Use `Matrix` to deal with matrices, which is faster than the built-in class
- R's OOP system uses generic functions not part of any class that dispatch on their arguments, and classes are just records with data (immutable and with copy semantics).
- For traditional (possibly mutable) OOP in R, check [Reference classes](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html).
- For prototype based OOP check [proto](http://code.google.com/p/r-proto/wiki/Overview).
- To use available parallelism, try `doMC` (for multicore) and `doMPI` (for many nodes, distributed). They have to be enabled with `registerDoMC(cores=8)`, and used with `%dopar%` or other functions (see `parallel`).
- A good classification and regression wrapper/tool package that uses parallelization is [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/).
