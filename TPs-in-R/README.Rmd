# Installation

In Ubuntu, R can be installed with `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev`. In case a newer version is needed, check [here](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README).

Then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is a good IDE for all platforms. The latest beta version is required to use `rmarkdown` and `shiny` from the menu.

Note that to create PDFs from *RStudio* in Ubuntu you also need `texlive-latex-extras` and `texlive-fonts-recommended`.

# Packages

There is no standard dependency manager that comes with R, but there are many solutions:

- Manually install from CRAN: `install.packages(NAME)`
- Manually install from github: `devtools::install_github("USER/REPO")` (requires *devtools*)
- Automatically with [rbundler](https://github.com/opower/rbundler)
- Automatically with [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)

Note that automatic dependency managers also track package versions for ensuring reproducibility and compatibility. The downside is that they store source and binaries under the project's directory.

# Content creation

With [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), it's possible to create HTML documents, slides for presentations and PDFs for reports directly from R. An advantage is to work with the real data, without need to export plots and import them in LaTeX or other programs (as well as keeping them up to date).

Another interesting option is to create interactive reports in the form of web pages or slides, also generated from R code without any HTML or Javascript. See [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/).

# Tips

- Use factors for qualitative (ordered or unordered) variables.
- Learn R's formula syntax as soon as possible: it's used for models, plots, etc.
- Make sure your data is in the [appropriate format](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) for these tools.
- Don't use base graphics, go for [lattice](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/graphics/lattice.cfm) or [ggplot2](http://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-cheatsheet-for-visualizing-distributions/).
- A better interface for transforming data is `plyr`, and for data frames [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).
- There are better alternatives for `summary` in [additional packages](http://www.statmethods.net/stats/descriptives.html).
- Use `reshape2` to convert factor variables to columns or vice versa
- Use `pander` to render tables when using `rmarkdown`
- A faster data frame implementation is [data.table](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/fast-summary-statistics-with-data-dot-table.html), still compatible with `dplyr`
- A good classification and regression wrapper/tool package that uses parallelization is [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/).

# Recommended packages

## Programming

- testthat: testing framework
- [megrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr): functional pipe operator to avoid nesting calls

### Paradigms
- R's OOP system uses generic functions not part of any class that dispatch on their arguments, and classes are just records with data (immutable and with copy semantics).
- For traditional (possibly mutable) OOP in R, check [Reference classes](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html).
- For prototype based OOP check [proto](http://code.google.com/p/r-proto/wiki/Overview).

### Optimization
- To use available parallelism, try `doMC` (for multicore) and `doMPI` (for many nodes, distributed). They have to be enabled with `registerDoMC(cores=8)`, and used with `%dopar%` or other functions (see `parallel`).
- [aprof](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/aprof): Amdahl's profiler, directed optimization made easy
- proftools: Profile Output Processing Tools for R
- [profr](https://github.com/hadley/profr): An alternative display for profiling information
- timeit: Easy profiling of R functions

## Graphics

### Plots
- GGally: additional graphics using ggplot2, like advanced scatter plot matrix
- plotrix: many additional plots, like radial/spider
- aplpack: special plots like stem.leaf, bagplot, faces, spin3R, plotsummary, plothulls
- pheatmap: better heatmap for visualizing matrices, also with dendrogram
- [ggtern](http://www.ggtern.com/): ternary diagrams for ggplot2
- [tabplot](https://github.com/mtennekes/tabplot): a visualization of large datasets, numerical and categorical

### Specific

- NeatMap: Non-clustered heatmap alternatives
- heplots: Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models

### Utilities
- gridExtra, gtable: arrange lattice/ggplot2 plots in a grid/table
- [directlabels](http://directlabels.r-forge.r-project.org/): direct labels for multicolor plots in lattice or ggplot2
- [ggsubplot](https://github.com/garrettgman/ggsubplot): explore complex data by embedding ggplot2 plots
- readbitmap, pixmap: read image files (jpg, png, bmp, etc)
